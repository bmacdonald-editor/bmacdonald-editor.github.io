Alex Miller is the founder of the Strange Loop conference that used to be held annually in St.Louis. I attended several times, and Alex was always happy to have publishers with a booth on site, especially Pragmatic. This book is an example of the synergy between Prag and Strange Loop. Clojure is an unusual language, but it has its fans, and they're usually passionate about it. That's the sort of space that Prag lives in, providing the content for the passionate.
