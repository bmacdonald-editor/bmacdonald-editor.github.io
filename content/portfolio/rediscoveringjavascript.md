One of my great pleasures in working at Pragmatic was getting to interact with Venkat Subramaniam. In addition to being amazingly knowledgeable, he's an incredibly fast writer and one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. So when he turned up wanting to write a JavaScript book that covered ES6 and beyond, we didn't hesitate.
