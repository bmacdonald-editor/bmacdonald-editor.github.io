This book underscored the benefits of conference attendance for an acquisitions editor. Normally, I go to conferences specifically to seek out potential authors, but if you go often enough, and engage with the community, sometimes authors come to you. This is a topic that I wasn't specifically looking for, but Michael knew me from THAT conference, got in touch, and we put together a proposal. As it turned out, I got to pitch the proposal to the committee while I was at THAT Conference, so I had the pleasure of delivering the good news to Michael in person.
