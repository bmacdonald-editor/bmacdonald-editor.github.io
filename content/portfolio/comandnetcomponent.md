This was the first title I edited for O'Reilly. I was just kicking off my freelance career, a friend connected me with John Osborn, and he needed a big edit on a tight deadline. I had some travel lined up, so as a result, I ended up editing this book on a laptop in a hotel room in Santa Clara, in just one week. Being stuck in a room does wonders for concentration. Fortunately, Juval is an excellent author. This was his first book as well, and although he had plenty of talent, he was new to writing in the O'Reilly style. Fortunately, he appreciated my work, which led to my working on several more books of his over a period of 15 years.
