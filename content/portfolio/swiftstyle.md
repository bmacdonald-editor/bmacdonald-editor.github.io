Style guides often make for interesting edits, because the structure normally doesn't need any tweaking, but the content is often strongly opinionated, so the editor has to question the author's assertions, which requires trust. Fortunately, Erica made that easy. She has a very strong author's voice, a keen analytical mind, and solid reasoning behind her decisions. It helps that we bonded over her nerdy pop-culture examples.
