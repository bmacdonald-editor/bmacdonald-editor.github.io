During my career, I've worked on books on complex topics, but I've usually been able to understand them and help the author accomplish their goals. When I transitioned to managing editor, I had to acknowledge that I wouldn't be working as closely with the text as I was used to, and sometimes I'd end up saying "Yeah, that's beyond me." This was one of those book. Fortunately, Dmitry and Adaobi know what they're talking about, because the book is successful.
