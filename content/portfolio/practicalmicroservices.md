I'm fond of this title for a couple of reasons. First, at the time I signed it, microservices were a very hot topic, but still tended to be discussed in rather abstract terms. I wanted a hands-on, example-based microservices book, and Ethan provided. The other reason is that I met Ethan at the Open West Conference in Utah, which I only attended at the urging of a friend, and it's one I suspect publishers weren't paying much attention to. Ethan was a great author to work with, very communicative, appreciative, and open to feedback, so I'm glad I got to meet him.
