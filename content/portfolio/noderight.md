Pragmatic doens't do a ton of books on the most popular languages, because that space is already pretty crowded. So if they were going to do a book on Node.js in 2017, they'd want to make sure they were doing it right. When they decide to publish on a popular topic, they want to make sure readers are getting something they won't get anywhere else. That's what this book provides.
