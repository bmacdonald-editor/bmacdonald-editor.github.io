Erica's first edition of Swift Style was a big hit, so it was natural that we'd do a second edition. Unfortunately, we were nearly done when Apple announced an official Swift style guide, something we had believed they didn't intend to do. That caught us a little off guard, but that's the way it goes in tech publishing sometimes. We decided to publish ebook-only, so as not to deprive the community of Erica's hard work.
