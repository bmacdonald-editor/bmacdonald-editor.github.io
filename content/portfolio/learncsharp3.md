This was the last of the books I coauthored for O'Reilly. After our successful collaboration on the previous edition, Jesse asked me to take a more active role in this revision. As a result, this book probably has more of me in it than any other. I didn't start from scratch, but I examined every word, revised where I felt was necessary, added clarification where it was needed, and rewrote all the practice exercises. Jesse contributed several new chapters at the end of the book, but even those I had a strong hand in. This book took up a large chunk of my year in 2008, and it's one of the things I'm most proud of.
