This is a book that by rights shouldn't have worked as well as it did. The idea is to compare ineffective Java code on the left page with optimized Java code on the right, and compare the differences. If you've got experience in book layout and design, you'll know that this trick requires quite a bit of care to pull off, more than most publishers would want to bother with. But it worked, and the result looks great.
