Joe Morgan is one of the most consistent and reliable authors I know. Some authors are great writers, others never miss a deadline, still others are great at taking feedback and building something better than what you suggested. Joe is the complete package. He's clear, concise, and responsible. He's an editor's dream, and I'm really glad I found him.
