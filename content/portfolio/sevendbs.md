Pragmatic's "Seven in Seven" is one of the few series concepts that the publisher has. We got pitched a lot of ideas with sevens in them, but when you have a series with a good reputation, you have to guard the quality of the individual entries closely. Fortunately, that wasn't a problem with _Seven Databases_, and having it come out as the NoSQL movement was warming up was a bonus.
