This was the second book that I co-authored for O'Reilly. Learning C# had gone well enough that Jesse asked if I'd contribute exercises to this book as well. The difference this time around was that I hadn't done any web development before, so I was learning as I went. They also decided to do the examples in Visual Basic, instead of C#, so they asked me to contribute some sidebars to help out folks who knew C#, but not VB. Of course, I was one of those people, so I had to teach myself VB to do it, but it turned out all right.
