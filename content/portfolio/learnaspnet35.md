This was the third book I co-authored for O'Reilly, and I was starting to feel a bit less like an imposter while doing it this time. I contributed a bit more this time around, in addition to my editorial responsibilities. I also think this book has the scariest animal of any O'Reilly book I've worked on, but Jesse and Dan both loved it.
