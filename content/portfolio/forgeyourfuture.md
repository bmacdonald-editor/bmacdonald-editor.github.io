This book in particular means a lot to me. It wasn't the first book I signed for Pragmatic, but it was the first time that somebody said "There should be a book about..." and I immediately thought "I know who can write that!" In this case, Publisher Andy Hunt said there should be a book on how to be a good open source contributor, and Vicky was the first and only person I thought of to write it. Vicky hadn't written at book length before, and I considered her more a friend than anything else at the time, but she was the clear choice. I had the opportunity to pitch her the idea in person when I attended a conference in her area, and that worked out quite well. 
Part of the promise I made to Vicky was that I'd be the development editor as well, and I'd walk her through the process of publishing for the first time, do I served as the development editor also. I usually stick to a "don't edit your friends" rule, but I bent it this time, and Vicky still speaks to me, so I guess that's all right. The title for this one took an awful lot of back-and-forth to resolve, but the cover was a slam dunk as soon as we saw it. Great content in a great package.
