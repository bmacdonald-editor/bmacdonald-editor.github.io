Sometimes a book surprises you by being more than you originally intended it to be. When I signed this book, I was looking for a really good F# book. Pragmatic historically stayed away from .NET languages, because the field is crowded, but I knew there weren't many F# books, and that F# attracts a different audience, one that's more in tune with Pragmatic's library. As it turns out, this isn't really an F# book. It's an amazing book on domain-driven design, whose examples happen to be in F#. I've heard from plenty of readers that this is the book that got them to understand domain modeling, and the language itself was incidental. In technical publishing, we accept that the books we work on become obsolete almost immediately. However, a very few stand the test of time, and this is one of them.
