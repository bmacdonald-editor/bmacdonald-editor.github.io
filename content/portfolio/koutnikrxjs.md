Randall is one of the most interesting, sharp, and downright entertaining authors I've worked with. He has a gift for explaining concepts in a way that probably no one else would think of, but absolutely makes sense. Almost all authors have a "voice," and if you know them personally, you can normally hear them when you read their work. But Randall's voice is one of the strongest I've heard. When I read his writing, it can't be anyone else but him.
