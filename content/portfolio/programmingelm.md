I met Jeremy at CodeMash, one of my favorite conferences, and it was clear from watching his session that he'd make a great author. I really enjoyed working on this book with him, and I found the Elm community to be welcoming and enthusiastic. Unfortunately, the language didn't catch on as I'd hoped it would.
