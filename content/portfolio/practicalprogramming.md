Pragmatic doesn't often do "learn to code" books; there are tons of those, and it's not their target audience. Which makes this an unusual book in Prag's catalog. The authors took the Pragmatic approach to programming and applied it to an introductory book. I've recommended this book to novice coders more than any other.
