This is the book that made me an O'Reilly author. I had worked with Jesse before, and he was happy to have me as his editor again. However, after some back-and-forth on the practice exercises, Jesse asked if I would write them, to save time, as well as some other pieces throughout the book. It was a challenge, but I learned a lot by seeing the process from the author's side. Although the book has been obsolete for a long time, once you're an author, no one can take that away from you, and it opened several doors for my career. My favorite outcome, though, was meeting a developer at a conference who said he'd learned C# from this book. Obvious, I know, but when you actually meet one of the people you wrote it for, and see how it affected their career, that makes all the difference.
