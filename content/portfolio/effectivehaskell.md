This one was a personal win for me. I know that Haskell will never be one of the most popular languages, but it has staying power. And while I was working for Pragmatic, I wanted a practical, hands-on book that taught using Haskell in real-world situations. I also attended the Strange Loop conference on a semi-regular basis, and I decided that if I couldn't sign a practical Haskell book at Strange Loop, it couldn't be done. Fortunately, I found Rebecca doing a lightning talk on just that topic, and it was amazing. We talked, I explained what I was looking for, and here's the finished product.
