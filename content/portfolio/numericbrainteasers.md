This book came about because Erica was working as Pragmatic's social media manager, among other roles. Erica has always had a passion for numerical puzzles, and she sprinkled some of those in with the news and product announcements. There were eventually enough of those that the bosses asked if she'd make a book out of them. Erica asked for me, as she had in the past, and although I had mostly stepped away from book editing at that point, I was happy to oblige.
